# websocket-sample
WebSocket sample application simulating WhatsApp QRCode authentication with Node.js, Bower and Grunt.

Clone this repository and run these commands:

```
$ bower install
$ npm install
$ grunt
$ node app.js
```

Open [http://localhost:9000](http://localhost:9000), take a picture of the QRCode and see (the magic) the following message changing from *"Waiting for mobile phone..."* to *"Received a smartphone call!"*. Use the QRCode Android/iOS app for that.

Try to use your browser dev tools plugin to see log messages on the console.
